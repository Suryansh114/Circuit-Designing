Hey there, This Repository includes my contributiion to Electrical engineering with emphasis on Electric-Vehicle Designing and component analysis.<br>
If you are new to this, this is the perfect place to be because even i am inmy learning phase.
I will be posting about the recent projects I started and keep up-to-date.

The projects are as follows:
1. EV Charger Reverse Engineering 
  â€¢	Reverse engineered a 3-wheeler EV charger, analyzing key components like MOSFETs, NTCs, controllers, capacitors, inductors, transformers, and diodes.
  â€¢	Mapped and designed a detailed circuit diagram to illustrate the functional flow, power conversion, and isolation mechanisms.
  â€¢	Demonstrated strong grasp of power electronics, thermal protection, and control systems through hands-on hardware analysis and system-level understanding.
2. Hybrid Energy Storage Simulation & Power Converter Design
  â€¢	Developed a MATLAB Simulink model integrating a battery and ultracapacitor to simulate vehicle acceleration, braking, and regenerative braking dynamics.
  â€¢	Designed and implemented a Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) converter, enabling efficient energy distribution between storage units and load.
  â€¢	Demonstrated advanced control strategies for energy management in EV systems, optimizing performance during transient conditions and regenerative phases.
Investment.

Even if these projects donâ€™t reach full completion, Iâ€™m focused on extracting meaningful learning and applying it to real-world challenges beyond academics.ðŸ˜Š
